Dependencies
------------

* php 5.4.0 or newer
* php5-ldap
* nodejs, npm, grunt-cli

Storage service client configuration
------------------------------------

The Archivematica storage service handles storage of AIPs. The DRMC interfaces
with it to allow the downloading of AIPs/AIP files and the recovery of AIPs.

# To interface with the Archivematica Storage Service, define these
  environment variables (e.g. in your PHP pool):

  env[ARCHIVEMATICA_SS_HOST] = "127.0.0.1"
  env[ARCHIVEMATICA_SS_PORT] = "8000"
  env[ARCHIVEMATICA_SS_PIPELINE_UUID] = "6117c5fa-d63f-44d8-9920-89468c68683e"


LDAP configuration
------------------

# Install php5-ldap and make sure that the module is being loaded.

# Define the following environment variables (e.g. in your PHP pool):

  env[ATOM_DRMC_LDAP_ADMIN_USERNAME] = "foo"
  env[ATOM_DRMC_LDAP_ADMIN_PASSWORD] = "bar"

# Create apps/qubit/config/factories.yml if it doesn't exist yet (this file is
  not tracked by git) with the following contents:

  all:
    user:
      class: adLdapUser

# Create apps/qubit/config/app.yml if it doesn't exist yet (this file is not
  tracked by git) with the following contents:

  all:
    ldap_account_suffix: "@example.com"
    ldap_base_dn: DC=EXAMPLE,DC=COM
    ldap_domain_controllers: ad01.example.com
    ldap_user_group: CN=AtoM users,OU=Archivists,OU=Groups,DC=EXAMPLE,DC=COM

# Clear the Symfony cache and restart your pool.

NOTE: This application will check if existing LDAP users are member of the group
defined in ldap_user_group.


Storage service AIP recovery process and configuration
------------------------------------------------------

AIP recovery support allows a DRMC administrator to replace a corrupt version
of a stored AIP with a correct version (restored from a backup, for example).

The AIP recovery process involves copying the recovered version of the AIP
into a dedicated recovery directory accessible by the storage service. You can
determine the location of this directory by clicking "Locations" in the storage
service administration web interface and finding the path assocated with AIP
recovery.

The DRMC's AIP recovery integration requires the storage service be configured
to report back to the DRMC when a storage service administrator has made a
decision about an AIP restore request (approving or rejecting it) or if an
approved AIP restore request has failed.

To configure the storage service to report AIP restore progress back to the
DRMC, click "Administration" in the storage service administration web
interface enter the following into the field labelled "Recover request
notification url" (replacing the DRMC server address placeholder with your
own DRMC server's address): 

  http://<DRMC server address>/api/recover/results

For authentication purposes, you'll also need to enter a valid DRMC username
and password into the two fields below it. Click "Save" when you're done.
